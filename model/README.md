# 3D Model Example
This is a simple example for loading a 3D model and rendering it. We...
- load the model-.obj to a VertexArray
- load the model texture
- create a ShaderProgram to render the model
- create a ModelInstance that allows us to generate a model matrix
- create a PerspectiveCamera that allows us to generate a projection view matrix
- enable depth testing
- render the model and rotate it

The 3D model has been taken from [here](https://maxparata.itch.io/voxelshop).
