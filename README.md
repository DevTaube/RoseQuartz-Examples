# RoseQuartz-Examples
This repository holds a collection of examples for the [RoseQuartz](https://devtaube.itch.io/rosequartz) game engine: 
- [Triange Example](triangle)
- [3D Model Example](model)

A guide on how to make a custom engine runtime can also be found [here](engine-runtime-guide).

Feel free to ask questions by creating an issue in the repository.

Also feel free to contribute and add other examples, but try to keep them as simple as possible (only doing what the example is about) and remember to comment / document your code.
